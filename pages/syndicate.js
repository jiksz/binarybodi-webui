            <h1 className="text-4xl montserrat text-blau ">How it works</h1>

            <p className="text-1xl text-white my-6  Poppitandfinch">Content value is determined by the screen resolution and content type. Pay per pixel pricing model. Anybody can create contents without any tech skills, The only eligibility to co create on the oracle is having a permanent Syndicate Pass. Bodi Syndic acts as a gateway of the Oracle, while leveraging the maximum potential of free speach.  </p>

            <p className="text-1xl text-white my-6  Poppitandfinch">Images, gif and videos have to be an NFT, before updating on the Oracle, if not then it will be updated as New NFT on behalf of the user. ( or MSP ??) Text contents can be either a Mirror.xyz url, if not  then it will be also created & updated on behalf of user( or msp?)  Intrinsic value of text is assesed through total world length. ( akind of pay per word). Since using random NFT's w/o having proper ownership results in IP issues hence ownership will be verified prior to publishing.  If you are BPYC #300 owner and You wanna write a poem about that, all you need to do is embed the image and add text, after ownership ver, it willm be published. If both text and media exist as nft's, then user can just add the links of address of the assets/url, which will automatically fetch the contents and publish it.</p>

            <p className="text-1xl text-white my-6  Poppitandfinch">Multiple users can c0- author on oracle like a novel can be made by 7 strangers across the globe w/o any irl. Multiple nft's can be added by muliple users w/o any issues.
              loyality rewards will be shared b/w all of them. Since every activity is carried onchain, we have the ability to estimate the performance of every user.  Creators/Authors will be credited with $BT [ Bodi ] for there contribution. $BODI is non transferable and non tradble token which has no market value. $Bodi is the governance token for the MPS, it will be airdropped for all Bodi Syndic holders and it is emitted to creators/authors for there contribution. Voting is periodically done for Content Syndication in which voters will choose the medias/contenst for each edition. </p>
